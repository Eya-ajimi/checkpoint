                    <p> Using online social networks in the educational process has been supported by several educational technology researchers, who have emphasized the benefits of technologies.

                 <dt> <h2> THE Disadvantages:</h2></dt>
                 <br> 
                 <section>
                     <h2> 1. Privacy problems</h2>
                     <p> Sharing your online location or getting in trouble at work because of tweeting something inappropriate or sharing too much with the public can cause you some issues that sometimes can’t ever be solved. </p>
                     <h2> 2. Reduces Family Intimacy </h2>
                     <p> Texting, Facebook, Twitter, etc. separate us from our families more than we actually think it does. When a family is spending family time together and watching a movie, in reality, most children are on their phones rather than watching the film with their parents.</p>
                     <h2> 3. It changes lifestyle habits, and it is sleep disruption</h2>
                     <p> <strong>  Since using a social network is all done on some computers or mobile devices, it can sometimes motivate too much sitting down in one place for too long.</strong>  Staring into the light from a computer or phone screen at night can negatively affect your ability to get a proper night sleep.
